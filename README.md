# 3T-Touch-table-Tablet-Communication
The aim of 3T is to give
users the ability to choose to share personal work with colleagues in the public setting of a
touch table, sharing directly from their personal devices, therefore opening up a new platform
for collaboration. Using this system, the group can then manipulate the size, orientation,
and location of the multiple pieces of work shared, as well as having the ability to add
comments, create links, and sketch free-form drawings. This project taps into the opportunity
for collaboration by developing two applications: one that runs in the web browser of a
touch table written in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery, and one that runs on a personal
Android device written in Android Java using Android Studio. With the goal of making
sharing personal work for public collaboration easier, the applications proposed use an online
database (Firebase) to enable two-way image and comment sharing between multiple
tablets and a touch table.

The key system requirements:  
R1 (Image Sharing). Two-way image sharing consists of users having the ability to
share their images from their personal device to the touch table, as well as receiving a
screen capture of the touch tables current state back to their personal device.  
R2 (Group Collaboration). Multi-touch on the touch table allows for many users to
work simultaneously and collaboratively on a task without the disruption of having
to limit the interaction to one person at a time.  
R3 (Resize/Rotate/Relocate). The ability to resize/rotate/relocate images on the table
using single-touch and multi-touch gestures designed to feel the most natural to users,
such as pinching for resizing, circling the item for rotation, and dragging the item for
relocation.  
R4 (Ease of Use). The system development should always be geared towards ease of
use and user enjoyment. The learning curve attributed to using 3T for the first time
should be kept as minimal as possible.  
R5 (Commenting). The comment system allows collaborators to comment on items on
the table and the owner of said item to receive those comments back to their personal
device. This enables users to refer to the comments made on their personal work when
revisiting that piece of work at a later time.  
R6 (Drawing). Free-form drawing is the final major application feature, giving multiple
users the ability to draw feedback, sketches, links, etc. on the table as they please.
This is included as another avenue for users to collaborate expressively, which is especially
important as 3T is a visual system.  
<br>
A key goal when designing the system was to keep the learning curve for first-time users
minimal. This enables those with minimal touch device experience to become involved in
the experience quickly and easily. This also minimises the fear of integrating a new technology
into everyday interactions.
